Product Differentiation
1. We have register, login and logout function which can help different users to get into their own 
   page. Everyone can access the product_list page, but only when user login they can submit order.
2. We add a connected sign in AUCommands to remind UPS we have successful connected.
3. In our query status part, we can search the status of our package not only the package status but
   also have the time of each status
4. We add change destination to Amazon side, and give it two ways to modify: 
    (a)Amazon can change the order destination if user want to change and then send the 
    request to UPS
    (b)UPS send a message to let Amazon know the destination is changed.
   As long as the package is not delivered, we can change the destination in both UPS and Amazon side.
5. We have a cart in our website where user can add items to it and remove it. When user found things
   they want in product_list, then they can add them to cart. As long as user submit in cart, the order
   is created.
